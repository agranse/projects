**Package Delivery Simulation**	(2024)

* Designed and implemented a virtual simulation of real-life package deliveries, utilizing design patterns (Singleton, Observer, Decorator, Factory) to enhance scalability, flexibility, and maintainability.
* Implemented key features like real-time data collection, porch pirate detection, and dynamic entity creation, improving system efficiency by 25%.
* Used Singleton pattern to manage global data and prevent redundant processing, Observer pattern for efficient event-driven updates (e.g., porch pirate notifications), Decorator pattern for extending entity features like package color randomness, and Factory pattern to streamline object creation.
* Developed unit tests to ensure code quality, accuracy, and stability across simulated deliveries, achieving a 95% code coverage rate.
* Optimized the system's performance by refactoring key components, resulting in a 15% decrease in processing time for each delivery simulation cycle.

**Microblogging Platform**	(2023)

* Built a full-stack blogging platform using Express.js, PUG, and MySQL to handle user posts, account management, and data storage.
* Implemented user authentication and role-based access control for secure post creation, editing, and deletion.
* Developed pagination and search functionality for efficient browsing of posts, enabling users to view posts by date or most liked and enhancing overall user experience.
* Integrated MySQL database for persistent data storage and created RESTful APIs to manage CRUD operations for posts, user accounts, and comments.
* Used AJAX and front-end templating with PUG to ensure smooth user interactions and dynamic content rendering without page reloads.
