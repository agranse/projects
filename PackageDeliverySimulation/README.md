A package delivery system containing entities such as delivery drones, helicopters, packages, and humans, that simulates package deliveries in real life. This simulation represented the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities campus. When running the user was able to choose the location of origin of a package, the location for the destination of the package, and a strategy for the delivery route. Once the delivery was scheduled, a drone would retrieve the package and deliver it to its destination. We used software dedsign principles to add extensions to this delivery system. These extensions included the data collection using the singleton pattern, thieves who stole packages using the observer pattern, random package color assignment via the decorator pattern, and the different types of entities via the factory pattern, as well as others.
The "service/include/simulationmodel" and "service/src/simulationmodel" folders display these extensions and the represent the core of what the project entailed.
